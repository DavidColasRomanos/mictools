MICtools
========

MICtools is an open source pipeline which combines the TIC_e and MIC_e measures
[Reshef2016]_ into a two-step procedure that allows to identify relationships of
various degrees of complexity in large datasets. TIC_e is used to perform 
efficiently a high throughput screening of all the possible pairwise
relationships and to assessing their significance, while MICe is used to rank 
the subset of significant associations on the bases of their strength.
